            <em>We can’t take it all with us</em> is a duratonal performance by rafa esparza and Yann Novak created to inhabit esparza’s
            exhibition <em>They spent their time doing nothing</em>. they let intimacy fuse them at the Vincent Price Art Museum. The
            piece incorporates sounds collected in Elysian Park when esparza took Novak on a guided tour of sites encountered by
            men seeking anonymous gay sexual encounters. Through the duration of the gallery hours Novak used these sounds in
            conjunction with synthesized sounds to pull the feeling and atmosphere of the park into the gallery.
        </p>
        <p>
            In preparing to encounter Novak’s work, esparza brought objects and materials that were interchangeably keepsakes and
            props from “performance art” work as well as a treasured experience that was non-art related. His presence in the
            gallery took form in response to both Novak’s sound performance and a re-membering of moments he spent in Elysian
            Park with Kate Gilbert, Nick Duran, Taisha Paggett, Felix Solano Vargas, Allison Wyper, EJ Hill, & Yann Novak.

        <p class="big-margin">Museum goers were invited to ‘cruise’ the performance by entering and exiting as they please.</p>

            <em>We can’t take it all with us</em> is an experimental website created for the <a href="https://rip.space"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rip Space</a> workshop “Censored Online, Thriving Offline.” It explores how age
            verification laws might impact individual artists sharing work that may contain borderline content.
